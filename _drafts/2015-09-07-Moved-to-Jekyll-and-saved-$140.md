Used Wordpress - struggled, bought a theme struggled

Tried Ghost, loved it, used it on Ongair's blog, but hosting for node too expensive for just a blog and the hacking needed to run it on bluehost was too much

i had heard of Jekyll before but never seriously considered it

Dealing with the Wordpress DB when moving around or reinstalling

Until my box got hacked and my website and my clients website went down,I spent a weekend trying to clean it up and i finally gave up,

So i moved to Jekyll

Costs me $0 to host

moved everything else to EAC directory, a good quality host

Looked for a good Jekyll found this one

After wrangling around with the
	baseurl
Problem and a couple of other gotchas, i was up and running. Jekyll is smooth and easy to theme and build
