## Fuck Work Life Balance

More work makes you more creative, the more misses you have the more hits you have

Why morale and fear kill creativity is precisely because people become less productive, more routine work is done, less daring

There are 2 factors to creativity Enthuthiasm and Experience - both are important factors, Younger Art directors have more enthuthiasm and are likely to spend more hours crafting, will older art directors have more experience and are likely to do less original work because of a wealth of heuristics 

More experienced Art directors are likely to be more cynical of work and want more free time, likely to have more commitment family etc their work is likely to be broader and deeper.

The work life balance curse, Arnold Lakita is likely the most creative Art director i have ever met, i also know of no one with a larger or broader body of work and very few creatives who produce the vast amount of work that Arnie spits out in a week

“ Creativity is a probabilistic consequence of productivity, across careers, those individual creators who are the most productive will also tend, on the average, to be the most creative: Individual variation in quantity is positively associated with variation in quality."

There is a direct correlation in drop of perceived creativity with the major commitments in your life, Marriage and childbirth, more for women but markedly for men

My personal experience - all i used to do is work 7 - 10pm was my sweet spot, it is also the sweet spot for my son and wife

Productivity goes back up once an individual acclimatises 

The most creative people are selfish, self absorbed and have no children - Creative work is a bug and the best work eats you up and spits you out as an offering

I was arguing with some friends on the question on of quality in Kenyan music and the verdict was clear, Kenyan Musicians are not as involved, Rihanna is wealthy yes but her music, the craft the gruel of it pushes her to madness, Femi kuti lived his music to the death, the famous Club 27.

Its Kenyanese to call things Creatives… a noun for the output and the outputter… “Send the creatives” “ I am meeting with the creatives “ this ambiguity shows the casualness with which margles approach creativity…a factor of production.

It is hard to explain how Creatives see their work, they are always surprised at how other people don’t take it seriously. i once had a discussion with  - Describe encounter with Sam Glchuru - 

How long can you concentrate and focus on one thing before your energy and attention begin to falter? How long does it take you to engage in a particular thing to make the effort of engagement worth it?

Creativity is hard work wrote All great artists and thinkers are great workers, indefatigable not only in inventing, but also in rejecting, sifting, transforming, ordering.” Nietzsche In Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, 

Weaving the golden thread according to Lehrer creativity is really putting things together in a form that makes sense

" The synthesizing mind takes information from disparate sources, understands and evaluates that information objectively, and puts it together in ways that make sense to the synthesizer and also to other persons. Valuable in the past, the capacity to synthesize becomes ever more crucial as information continues to mount at dizzying rates.”

Woody Allen famously declared that “Eighty percent of success is showing up”. Grit is what allows you show up again and again.

We were having a discussion about the 3d industry in Kenya with a couple of agency rats and we ahd an open kimono session where you know you call a spade a spade, "Is this the best 3d work possible ?" everyone agreed that it's pretty shit and there is a lot better work down south.

The point is that most 3d people dont get as much practice as art directors, their craft tends to stay "Good enough for goverment" the dont get taken through the factory where ROJ - Return on Jpeg rules so they dont get to produce good work with a gun to their heads
