## Fuck Work Life Balance

More work makes you more creative, the more misses you have the more hits you have

Why morale and fear kill creativity is precisely because people become less productive, more routine work is done, less daring

There are 2 factors to creativity Enthuthiasm and Experience - both are important factors, Younger Art directors have more enthuthiasm and are likely to spend more hours crafting, will older art directors have more experience and are likely to do less original work because of a wealth of heuristics
