<p>Used Wordpress - struggled, bought a theme struggled</p>

<p>Tried Ghost, loved it, used it on Ongair&#39;s blog, but hosting for node too expensive for just a blog and the hacking needed to run it on bluehost was too much</p>

<p>i had heard of Jekyll before but never seriously considered it</p>

<p>Dealing with the Wordpress DB when moving around or reinstalling</p>

<p>Until my box got hacked and my website and my clients website went down,I spent a weekend trying to clean it up and i finally gave up,</p>

<p>So i moved to Jekyll</p>

<p>Costs me $0 to host</p>

<p>moved everything else to EAC directory, a good quality host</p>

<p>Looked for a good Jekyll found this one</p>

<p>After wrangling around with the
    baseurl
Problem and a couple of other gotchas, i was up and running. Jekyll is smooth and easy to theme and build</p>
