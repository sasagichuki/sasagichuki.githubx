## Dr Seuss

Theodore Geisel wanted to be a serious writer, he was waiting for the day when he would arrive 

I once had this monologue in a movie, the movie was not remarkable but the monologue grabbed me, i rewound several times so that i could write it down....  

I did not know that Dr. Seuss was a failed writer, or so he thought of himself, a lot of us can identify with the Waiting Place, that limbo in between who we are and what we think we should be.

Now Theodore though of himself as a mediorce writter, he had not made his mark.... on the side theodore would write childrens books under a pseudonym .. you just in case he became famous and he could use his real name... Well Theodore never really became a serious writer.... but his alternate self became the writer of the most famous children books, Dr. Seuss... Seuss being his middle name Theodore Seuss Geisel

Often we are stuck in the same place... The Waiting Place...  everyone is waiting for something Pete Odera is one sharp chap, I have never forgotten this line from one of his sermons "Africa's failure is postponing excellence " frankly that is everyones failure, not sweating the details now, not putting in that extra hour, always waiting for when you will be a bit older, raise more money, have more time,

it sevral times to write it down,  [link] but the poem left a mark in my head... until yesterday when i learned that it was penned by Theodore Geisel... a failed writer.....

Also known as Dr Seuss!

Dr. Seuss’s real name was Theodore Geisel. He used the pseudonym “Seuss”–his middle name–because he was waiting until he possessed the talent and experience necessary to write, as he put it, “the next great American novel.” That novel never materialized, but Geisel spent his life writing the most popular and significant children’s books in history. It would be hard to call his career anything but an incredible success. But he was always waiting. He was waiting for himself to become a “serious” writer, which he would never become.

The last book Geisel published was a fittingly serious story about the peaks and valleys of life called Oh, The Places You’ll Go! It is perhaps his Greatest book, but I hadn’t read it until a few months ago. In the months since, one part of the book has stuck with me, festering in the back of my mind. It hit me particularly hard when I read it the first time:

> You can get so confused
> that you’ll start in to race
> down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
> and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
> headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
> The Waiting Place…

> …for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

> Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

> NO! That’s not for you!

> Somehow you’ll escape
all that waiting and staying.
You’ll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

The most destructive thing smart people do is spend their lives waiting. Even people with lofty dreams and aspirations get distracted by the inertia of ordinary events and subconsciously store their goals in the waiting place.

Tomorrow. After my promotion. When I raise money. When the time is right. After I settle things up. When I’m done learning.

These phrases appear to be valid reasons for waiting, but they are usually just excuses used to rationalize an easier choice. Worse still, waiting is so much easier than working towards a goal that it is completely reasonable to economically justify entering the waiting place. And while it may be an easy place, it is a wholly unfulfilling place.

Like Geisel, I’ve spent a lot of my life there. But as I continue The Fight, I hope never to return.
