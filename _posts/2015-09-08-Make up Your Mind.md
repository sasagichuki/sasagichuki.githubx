## Make up you Mind

Society is set up to make us believe that we have endless choice,

we were brought up and trained to master many things just in case, we are Pseudo American (and worse) we are indefinite pessimimist who hedge bets and resign ourselves to fate...

"Indefinite attitudes to the future explain what’s most dysfunctional in our world today. Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes Americans today. In middle school, we’re encouraged to start hoarding “extracurricular activities.” In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready— for nothing in particular..."

That's a piece of wisdom from Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and author of Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future,

I loved Peter thiels thinking on How education has affected our choices....

" "

That sums it up so well

But what do i know ?
