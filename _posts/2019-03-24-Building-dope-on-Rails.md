##Building a Dribbble like app in Rails

You know nothing,

Alright, so this is not the hardest thing to build but what do i know

Dribbble allows users to post and like stuff

ADCC needed one of these so i thought let me see if i can build one and document the whole build so that anyone else can follow and build one of their own

Here is the video, and you can clone the entire site here
[Dope](www.github.com)

##Start
Lets assume you already have rails and you dev machine is all set up, lets also assume that you already understand some basic Ruby on Rails just like me... Dope

open your terminal in your projects folder and go
	rails new dope
